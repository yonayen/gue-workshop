git repository is a set of points in time showing where we've been.

Each point has a HASH (long number) that identifies it.

touch _____  (creates new file)

HEAD always points to where we currently are on sequence

"master" is first branch (default timeline)

label for "master' moves to new point of commit

create new branch:  git branch git-notes

git branch (to see all branches)

checkout command to change to other branch

git checkout git-notes

touch git_notes.txt


git remote -v (to confirm that everything only exists here on my computer)

git remote add origin https://github.com/yonayen/gue-workshop.git
(using http)

git remote -v

git push -u origin master  (push master to github)!!
